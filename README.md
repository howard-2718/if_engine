# if_engine
 interactive fiction engine, made from scratch (and with java)

This repo is actually a Java port of a REPL I created a few months back in Python, under a different moniker. The REPL was left in a pretty unfinished state, and also contains some pretty funky code. Hopefully, I'll be able to expand this project in Java, and make some good improvements.

I just uploaded my entire IntelliJ Idea project to this repo, but I think src is the only folder worth looking at. Feel free to compile, play, fork, etc.
